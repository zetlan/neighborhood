"""A game of matching home buyers to their neighborhoods.

Some portions of this have been modeled after, adapted from, or wholesale copied
from the `matching` module here: https://github.com/daffidwilde/matching. Out-of-the-box that 
module would solve a base Hospital-Resident matching game, but we need to sort potential homebuyers
by their "fit" to the neighborhoods, and while subclass-and-override might be a fine approach, it would
also require setting up `matching` and its dependency `NumPy`, and I'm trying to get this done without
falling into Dependency Hell.

    Solve a matching 'game' using an adapted Gale-Shapley algorithm in which residents rank their preferences
    for neighborhoods, and neighborhood preferences are based on 'fit' of residents who prefer them to that neighborhood.

    This was shamelessly sto-- uh, borrowed, from the `matching` package. Gale & Shapley proved that there are two solutions
    to the stable matching problem in which members of two separate populations rank their preferences for each other;
    the algorithm can produce a match that is optimal for one population or the other. Here we use a buyer-optimal match,
    which should produce an arrangement of homebuyers in neighborhoods such that no homebuyer would be a better fit for a 
    neighborhood they'd prefer more than the one they're in.
